                    In KAIST, masterâ€™s program is research-oriented, which means that every student needs to join a research group and writes a thesis. In fact, after admission, students are allowed to select their preferred lab, and the department makes the best effort to accommodate these requests (though acceptance to a specific lab is not guaranteed, as it depends on the number of applications received).
